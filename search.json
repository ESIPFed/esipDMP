(see below on how to submit feedback)\n\n\nGood data management requires planning, and most funding agencies require structured, comprehensive details describing how research outputs, like data, software, samples, etc. will be collected, stored, shared, and archived. these details are often compiled in Data Management Plans, otherwise known as “DMPs”. Note that different agencies and organizations may have slightly different titles and acronyms for DMPs (see acronym list for more examples).\nThis resource offers examples of DMPs from ESIP-relevant funding agencies (listed below), with the goal of providing:\n\nan overview of the sections/topics that should be covered in a DMP,\na brief description of best practices for those sections/topics, and\nexamples of DMPs from proposals funded by ESIP-relevant funding agencies.\n\n\nESIP-relevant data management plan sources (as of July 2025):\nNote: Many of these DMP sources provide services to help with DMP creation.

DMPTool provides templates from a number of agencies, including those listed above, examples of published DMPs, and allows you to request a DOI for your DMP (highly recommended!). DMPTool is also working on creating machine-actionable DMPs (ma-DMPs), which will greatly improve the ability of funders and publishers to better track the impact of the research outputs from your science, as described in your DMP! Stay tuned for exciting advancements in this area, and read here for more information.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis resource was created as a working group partnership between the ESIP Marine Data Cluster and the ESIP Data Stewardship Committee.

File types: Short-read archive (.sra), raw sequencing files (.fastq), assembled fasta files (.fasta), annotation files (.gff). Repository: NCBI; accession numbers will be provided to BCO-DMO.\nPhysiological experiment data: Physiological experiments carried out on 10 different E. huxleyi strains will be conducted in the lab. Physiological and chemical parameters of the cultures will be collected over time including: growth rate, cell size, Fv/Fm, chlorophyll, particulate organic carbon, particulate inorganic carbon, dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus, and particulate nitrogen and phosphorus. File types: csv files. Repository: BCO-DMO.\nBioinformatic pipelines: Analysis of all genetic sequencing data will be done through the construction of reproducible pipelines designed in Snakemake. These pipelines will be made public on GitHub and archived and provided a doi through Zenodo. Repository: Zenodo; doi will be provided to BCO-DMO.",

Nucleic acids extracted from collected animals will be labeled with precise site of origin (latitude, longitude), date of collection, and species and archived in the Reitzel and Burt laboratories.
