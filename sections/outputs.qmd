## What Research Outputs Are Being Produced?

Research outputs include a variety of materials and data generated during the research process. These may include:

- **Samples**
  - Physical samples (e.g., biological, chemical, geological)
  - Digital samples (e.g., scanned images, 3D models)
- **Data**
  - Raw data
  - Processed data
  - Metadata
- **Collections**
  - Curated sets of samples or data
- **Software**
  - Code, scripts, or applications developed for analysis
- **Materials**
  - Lab protocols, reagents, or experimental setups
- **Models**
  - Statistical, mathematical, or computational models
- **Documents/Posters/Pre-prints/Publications/Videos**
  - Research papers, conference posters, pre-prints, and multimedia content

## Number and Size of Research Outputs

- **Number of files, samples, collections, etc.**
  - Estimated count of each type of output.
- **Size of each file, sample, etc.**
  - File sizes (e.g., MB, GB, TB) for digital outputs.
  - Physical dimensions or quantities for physical samples.

## Metadata Critical for Data Interpretation and Reuse

- **Sensor metadata**
  - Information about instruments or sensors used to collect data.
- **Sampling effort metadata**
  - Details about sampling methods, locations, and conditions.
