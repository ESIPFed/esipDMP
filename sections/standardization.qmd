title: "Standardization of Data and Metadata"
---

## How Will It Be Standardized?

### Data / Metadata Formats
- Use of widely accepted formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, HDF5 for data; XML, JSON-LD for metadata).
- Consistent naming conventions and file structures.

### Standards
- Adherence to domain-specific standards (e.g., Darwin Core for biodiversity data, DICOM for medical imaging).
- Compliance with FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

### QA/QC Methods
- Implementation of quality assurance and quality control processes.
- Regular audits and validation checks to ensure data integrity.
